   * <p>Some applications need to create/write-to side-files, which differ from
   * the actual job-outputs.
   * 
   * <p>In such cases there could be issues with 2 instances of the same TIP 
   * (running simultaneously e.g. speculative tasks) trying to open/write-to the
   * same file (path) on HDFS. Hence the application-writer will have to pick 
   * unique names per task-attempt (e.g. using the attemptid, say 
   * <tt>attempt_200709221812_0001_m_000000_0</tt>), not just per TIP.</p> 
   * 
   * <p>To get around this the Map-Reduce framework helps the application-writer 
   * out by maintaining a special 
   * <tt>${mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir}/_temporary/_${taskid}</tt> 
   * sub-directory for each task-attempt on HDFS where the output of the

   * in the <tt>${mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir}/_temporary/_${taskid}</tt> (only) 
   * are <i>promoted</i> to <tt>${mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir}</tt>. Of course, the 
   * framework discards the sub-directory of unsuccessful task-attempts. This 
   * is completely transparent to the application.</p>
   * 
   * <p>The application-writer can take advantage of this by creating any 
   * side-files required in <tt>${mapreduce.task.output.dir}</tt> during execution 
   * of his reduce-task i.e. via {@link #getWorkOutputPath(JobConf)}, and the 
   * framework will move them out similarly - thus she doesn't have to pick

   * execution of a particular task-attempt is actually 
   * <tt>${mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir}/_temporary/_{$taskid}</tt>, and this value is

 * <p>
 * A dynamic Bloom filter (DBF) makes use of a <code>s * m</code> bit matrix but
 * each of the <code>s</code> rows is a standard Bloom filter. The creation 
 * process of a DBF is iterative. At the start, the DBF is a <code>1 * m</code>
 * bit matrix, i.e., it is composed of a single standard Bloom filter.
 * It assumes that <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> elements are recorded in the 
 * initial bit vector, where <code>n<sub>r</sub> <= n</code> (<code>n</code> is
 * the cardinality of the set <code>A</code> to record in the filter).  
 * <p>
 * As the size of <code>A</code> grows during the execution of the application,
 * several keys must be inserted in the DBF.  When inserting a key into the DBF,
 * one must first get an active Bloom filter in the matrix.  A Bloom filter is
 * active when the number of recorded keys, <code>n<sub>r</sub></code>, is 
 * strictly less than the current cardinality of <code>A</code>, <code>n</code>.
 * If an active Bloom filter is found, the key is inserted and 
 * <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> is incremented by one. On the other hand, if there
 * is no active Bloom filter, a new one is created (i.e., a new row is added to
 * the matrix) according to the current size of <code>A</code> and the element
 * is added in this new Bloom filter and the <code>n<sub>r</sub></code> value of
 * this new Bloom filter is set to one.  A given key is said to belong to the
 * DBF if the <code>k</code> positions are set to one in one of the matrix rows.
