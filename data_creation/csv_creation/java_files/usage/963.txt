 *   <hostname> and <port> describe the TCP server that Spark Streaming would connect to receive
 *   data. <checkpoint-directory> directory to HDFS-compatible file system which checkpoint data
 *   <output-file> file to which the word counts will be appended
 *
 * <checkpoint-directory> and <output-file> must be absolute paths

 *
 *      `$ nc -lk 9999`
 *
 * and run the example as
 *
 *      `$ ./bin/run-example org.apache.spark.examples.streaming.JavaRecoverableNetworkWordCount \
 *              localhost 9999 ~/checkpoint/ ~/out`
