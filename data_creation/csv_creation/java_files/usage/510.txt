Functions:
	 *   - replace "/" or "\" by system's separator
	 *   - replace multiple separators by single one
	 *   - skip "/./" 
	 *   - skip quotes
	 * 
	 * Note: "/../" is left untouched on purpose in order to work properly under
	 * circumstances such as this:
	 * 
	 * header file at include_1/vector:
	 *   // Is supposed to find the STL vector header:
	 *   #include <ext/../vector>
	 *   
	 * GCC include tree 
	 *   include_gcc/ext/...
	 *              /vector
	 * 
	 * (ls include_1/ext/../vector does not work either).
