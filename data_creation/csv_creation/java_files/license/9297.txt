/**
 * Alternative to the Guice {@link com.google.inject.Provider} that throws
 * a checked Exception. Users may not inject {@code T} directly.
 *
 * <p>This interface must be extended to use application-specific exception types.
 * Such subinterfaces may not define new methods, but may narrow the exception type.
 * <pre>
 * public interface RemoteProvider&lt;T&gt; extends CheckedProvider&lt;T&gt; { 
 *   T get() throws CustomExceptionOne, CustomExceptionTwo;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>When this type is bound using {@link ThrowingProviderBinder}, the value returned
 * or exception thrown by {@link #get} will be scoped. As a consequence, {@link #get}
 * will invoked at most once within each scope.
 * 
 * @since 3.0
