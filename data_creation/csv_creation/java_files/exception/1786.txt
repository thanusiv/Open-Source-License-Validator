However, knowing only the column type may not be sufficient to handle the data properly.
 * For instance, a double column with values 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ... may represent some label indices,
 * which cannot be treated as numeric values in ML algorithms, and, for another instance, we may
 * want to know the names and types of features stored in a vector column.
 * ML attributes are used to provide additional information to describe columns in a dataset.
