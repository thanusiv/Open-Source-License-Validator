A PBImageDelimitedTextWriter generates a text representation of the PB fsimage,
 * with each element separated by a delimiter string.  All of the elements
 * common to both inodes and inodes-under-construction are included. When
 * processing an fsimage with a layout version that did not include an
 * element, such as AccessTime, the output file will include a column
 * for the value, but no value will be included.
 *
 * Individual block information for each file is not currently included.
 *
 * The default delimiter is tab, as this is an unlikely value to be included in
 * an inode path or other text metadata. The delimiter value can be via the
 * constructor.
