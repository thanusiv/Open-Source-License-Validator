/**
 * This interface can be implemented by clients to contribute custom build-option 
 * editors to the CDT Build Settings page in the project Properties dialog.
 * 
 * In addition to implementing this interface, the custom build-option editor class
 * must also extend the {@link org.eclipse.jface.preference.FieldEditor} class. The
 * custom build-option editor class should be contributed through the <fieldEditor> 
 * element of the org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.buildDefinitionsUI extension-point,
 * and then referenced, by its ID, from the <option>/fieldEditorId attribute of the 
 * org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.buildDefinitions extension-point.
