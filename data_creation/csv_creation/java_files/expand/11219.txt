/**
   * The corrupt block has to be removed when the number of valid replicas
   * matches replication factor for the file. In this test, the above 
   * condition is achieved by increasing the number of good replicas by 
   * replicating on a new Datanode. 
   * The test strategy : 
   *   Bring up Cluster with 3 DataNodes
   *   Create a file  of replication factor 3
   *   Corrupt one replica of a block of the file 
   *   Verify that there are still 2 good replicas and 1 corrupt replica 
   *     (corrupt replica should not be removed since number of good replicas
   *      (2) is less  than replication factor (3)) 
   *   Start a new data node 
   *   Verify that the a new replica is created and corrupt replica is
   *   removed.
