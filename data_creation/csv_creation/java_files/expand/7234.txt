/**
	 * Returns a string representation of this element handle. The format of the
	 * string is not specified; however, the identifier is stable across
	 * workspace sessions, and can be used to recreate this handle via the
	 * <code>CoreModel.create(String)</code> method.
	 * <p>
	 * Some element types, like binaries, do not support handle identifiers and
	 * return {@code null}.
