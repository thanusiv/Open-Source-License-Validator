The Qt implementation ensures uniqueness by creating only a single instance of
		// the IASTName for each thing that should create a single instance in the PDOM.
		// This will work as long as all Qt elements are updated at once, which is currently
		// the case.
		//
		// I don't think this needs to be thread-safe, because things are only added from
		// the single indexer task.
