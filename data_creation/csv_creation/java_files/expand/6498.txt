We need to cover the following cases:
 * 1. No snapshot, truncate to 0
 * 2. No snapshot, truncate at block boundary
 * 3. No snapshot, not on block boundary
 * 4~6. With snapshot, all the current blocks are included in latest
 *      snapshots, repeat 1~3
 * 7~9. With snapshot, blocks in the latest snapshot and blocks in the current
 *      file diverged, repeat 1~3
