<p>{@link TotalHeapUsageEmulatorPlugin} emulates the heap usage in steps. 
 * The frequency of emulation can be configured via 
 * {@link #HEAP_EMULATION_PROGRESS_INTERVAL}.
 * Heap usage values are matched via emulation only at specific interval 
 * boundaries.
 * </p>
 *  
 * {@link TotalHeapUsageEmulatorPlugin} is a wrapper program for managing 
 * the heap usage emulation feature. It internally uses an emulation algorithm 
 * (called as core and described using {@link HeapUsageEmulatorCore}) for 
 * performing the actual emulation. Multiple calls to this core engine should 
 * use up some amount of heap.
