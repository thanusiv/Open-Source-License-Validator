 <p>This saves memory over creating a new OutputStream and
 * ByteArrayOutputStream each time data is written.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage is something like the following:<pre>
 *
 * OutputBuffer buffer = new OutputBuffer();
 * while (... loop condition ...) {
 *   buffer.reset();
 *   ... write buffer using OutputStream methods ...
 *   byte[] data = buffer.getData();
 *   int dataLength = buffer.getLength();
 *   ... write data to its ultimate destination ...
 * }
 * </pre>
