  * Listener interface for the various types of JSR-286 portlet requests. The
     * listener methods are called by the request handler
     * {@link PortletListenerNotifier} after the session is locked and the
     * corresponding UI has been found (if already created) but before other
     * request processing takes place.
     * 
     * Direct rendering of output is not possible in a portlet listener and the
     * JSR-286 limitations on allowed operations in each phase or portlet
     * request processing must be respected by the listeners.
     * 
     * Note that internal action requests used by the framework to trigger
     * events or set shared parameters do not call the action request listener
     * but will result in a later event or render request that will trigger the
     * corresponding listener.
