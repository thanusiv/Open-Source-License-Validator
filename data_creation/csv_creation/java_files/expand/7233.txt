	 * Returns whether the structure of this element is known. For example, for a
	 * translation unit that could not be parsed, {@code false} is returned.
	 * If the structure of an element is unknown, navigations will return reasonable
	 * defaults. For example, {@code getChildren} will return an empty collection.
