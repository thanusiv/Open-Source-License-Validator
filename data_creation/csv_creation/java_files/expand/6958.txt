Test that VirtualBoundsGraphicObject scale correctly.
	 * To do that create a hierarchy of graphical object using virtual coordinates
	 * and sizes (bounds). Then set the real, pixel-bounds for the outer-most object.
	 * Verify that child objects end-up with expected pixel bounds.
	 *
	 * Also test retrieval of child objects.
