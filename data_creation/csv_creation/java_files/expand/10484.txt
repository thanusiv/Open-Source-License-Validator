 // The below logic allows us to keep the checked state of the toggle button
    // properly set.  This is because in some case, the checked state may change
    // without the user actually pressing the button.  For instance, if we restart
    // the inferior, the toggle may automatically turn off.
    // To figure this out, whenever a debug context changes, we make sure we are
    // showing the proper checked state.
