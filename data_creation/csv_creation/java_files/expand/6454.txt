Extract the substring that likely contributes to this Q_PROPERTY declaration.  The declaration
		// could be in any state of being entered, so use the HeuristicScanner to guess about the
		// possible structure.  The fixed assumptions are that the content assistant was invoked within
		// the expansion parameter of Q_PROPERTY.  We try to guess at the end of the String, which is
		// either the closing paren (within 512 characters from the opening paren) or the current cursor
		// location.

		// The offset is always right after the opening paren, use it to get to a fixed point in the
		// declaration.
