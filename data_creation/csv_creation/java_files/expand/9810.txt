  /**
   * This method transfers data using local buffer. It transfers data from 
   * a disk to a local buffer in memory, and then it transfers data from the 
   * buffer to the target. This is used only if transferTo is disallowed in
   * the configuration file. super.TransferTo does not perform well on Windows 
   * due to a small IO request generated. customShuffleTransfer can control 
   * the size of the IO requests by changing the size of the intermediate 
   * buffer.
