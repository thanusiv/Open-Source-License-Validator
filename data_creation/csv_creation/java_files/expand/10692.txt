 * This Iterator wraps another iterator and gives it a bug found
   * in JDK6.
   *
   * <p>This bug is this: if you create an iterator from a TreeSet
   * and call next() on that iterator when hasNext() is false, so
   * that next() throws a NoSuchElementException, then subsequent
   * calls to remove() will incorrectly throw an IllegalStateException,
   * instead of removing the last element returned.
