 /**
   * The corrupt block has to be removed when the number of valid replicas
   * matches replication factor for the file. In this the above condition is
   * tested by reducing the replication factor 
   * The test strategy : 
   *   Bring up Cluster with 3 DataNodes
   *   Create a file of replication factor 3 
   *   Corrupt one replica of a block of the file 
   *   Verify that there are still 2 good replicas and 1 corrupt replica
   *    (corrupt replica should not be removed since number of good
   *     replicas (2) is less than replication factor (3))
   *   Set the replication factor to 2 
   *   Verify that the corrupt replica is removed. 
   *     (corrupt replica  should not be removed since number of good
   *      replicas (2) is equal to replication factor (2))
