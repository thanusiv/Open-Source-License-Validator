     * If the {@link Component} is found in cache and this function returns true
     * it may omit the content and close the tag, in which case cached content
     * should be used.

     * This method may also add only a reference to the paintable and queue the
     * paintable to be painted separately.

     * <p>
     * Each paintable being painted should be closed by a matching
     * {@link #endPaintable(Component)} regardless of the {@link PaintStatus}
     * returned.
