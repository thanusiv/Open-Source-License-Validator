/**
 * Represents expansions of the Q_ENUMS macro within a class declaration.
 * <pre>
 * class B : public QObject
 * {
 * Q_OBJECT
 * enum E { enumerator };
 * Q_ENUMS( E )
 * };
 *
 * class Q : public QObject
 * {
 * Q_OBJECT
 * Q_ENUMS( B::E E0 )
 * Q_ENUMS( E1 )
 * enum E0 { e0a, e0b = 2 };
 * enum E1 { e1 };
 * }
 * </pre>
 * NOTE: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qobject.html#Q_ENUMS
 * <blockquote>
 * If you want to register an enum that is declared in another class, the enum must be fully qualified
 * with the name of the class defining it. In addition, the class defining the enum has to inherit
 * QObject as well as declare the enum using Q_ENUMS().
 * </blockquote>
 * So, the lookup for the C++ enum only needs to look in the same class spec when the name is not
 * qualified.  When it is qualified, then it needs to find the QObject and then look at its Q_ENUMS.
