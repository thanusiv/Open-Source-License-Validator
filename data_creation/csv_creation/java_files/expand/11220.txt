 /**
   * The corrupt block has to be removed when the number of valid replicas
   * matches replication factor for the file. The above condition should hold
   * true as long as there is one good replica. This test verifies that.
   * 
   * The test strategy : 
   *   Bring up Cluster with 2 DataNodes
   *   Create a file of replication factor 2 
   *   Corrupt one replica of a block of the file 
   *   Verify that there is  one good replicas and 1 corrupt replica 
   *     (corrupt replica should not be removed since number of good 
   *     replicas (1) is less than replication factor (2)).
   *   Set the replication factor to 1 
   *   Verify that the corrupt replica is removed. 
   *     (corrupt replica should  be removed since number of good
   *      replicas (1) is equal to replication factor (1))
