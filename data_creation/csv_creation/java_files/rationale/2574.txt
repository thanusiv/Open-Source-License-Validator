The maps are incrementally updated as described below:
 *   1. Initialize the maps as empty. 
 *   2. Incrementally update the maps
 *      - When ShellBasedIdMapping is requested for user or group name given 
 *        an ID, or for ID given a user or group name, do look up in the map
 *        first, if it doesn't exist, find the corresponding entry with shell
 *        command, and insert the entry to the maps.
 *      - When group ID is requested for a given group name, and if the
 *        group name is numerical, the full group map is loaded. Because we
 *        don't have a good way to find the entry for a numerical group name,
 *        loading the full map helps to get in all entries.
 *   3. Periodically refresh the maps for both user and group, e.g,
 *      do step 1.
