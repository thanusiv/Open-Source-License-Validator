 This helper method will invoke the specified function in parallel for each
   * end point in the specified list using a thread pool and return the
   * responses received from the function. It implements the logic required for
   * dispatching requests in parallel and waiting for the responses. If any of
   * the function call fails or times out, it will ignore and proceed with the
   * rest. So the responses returned can be less than the number of end points
   * specified
