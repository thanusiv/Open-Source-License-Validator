If the directory ~/checkpoint/ does not exist (e.g. running for the first time), it will create
 * a new StreamingContext (will print "Creating new context" to the console). Otherwise, if
 * checkpoint data exists in ~/checkpoint/, then it will create StreamingContext from
 * the checkpoint data.

 * Refer to the online documentation for more details.
