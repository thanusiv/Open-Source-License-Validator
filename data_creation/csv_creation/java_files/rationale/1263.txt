Platform's SpellingService uses a spelling engine that is independent
 * of the content type (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=185695).
 * We are providing our own SpellingService to be able to use the C/C++ specific
 * spelling engine even when it is not selected in
 * Preferences/General/Editors/Text Editors/Spelling.
