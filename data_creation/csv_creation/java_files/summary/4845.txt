A {@link PreemptionMessage} is part of the RM-AM protocol, and it is used by
 * the RM to specify resources that the RM wants to reclaim from this
 * {@code ApplicationMaster} (AM). The AM receives a {@link
 * StrictPreemptionContract} message encoding which containers the platform may
 * forcibly kill, granting it an opportunity to checkpoint state or adjust its
 * execution plan. The message may also include a {@link PreemptionContract}
 * granting the AM more latitude in selecting which resources to return to the
 * cluster.
