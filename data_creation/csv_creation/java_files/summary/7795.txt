/**
 * Criterion that can be used create policy to accept/discard dragged content
 * (presented by {@link Transferable}).
 * 
 * The drag and drop mechanism will verify the criteria returned by
 * {@link DropHandler#getAcceptCriterion()} before calling
 * {@link DropHandler#drop(DragAndDropEvent)}.
 * 
 * The criteria can be evaluated either on the client (browser - see
 * {@link ClientSideCriterion}) or on the server (see
 * {@link ServerSideCriterion}). If no constraints are needed, an
 * {@link AcceptAll} can be used.
 * 
 * In addition to accepting or rejecting a possible drop, criteria can provide
 * additional hints for client side painting.
