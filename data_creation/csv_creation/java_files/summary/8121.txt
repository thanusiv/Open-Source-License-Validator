   * Injects dependencies into the fields and methods of {@code instance}. Ignores the presence or
   * absence of an injectable constructor.
   *
   * <p>Whenever Guice creates an instance, it performs this injection automatically (after first
   * performing constructor injection), so if you're able to let Guice create all your objects for
   * you, you'll never need to use this method.
   *
   * @param instance to inject members on. May be {@code null}.
