The {@link JWTRedirectAuthenticationHandler} extends
 * AltKerberosAuthenticationHandler to add WebSSO behavior for UIs. The expected
 * SSO token is a JsonWebToken (JWT). The supported algorithm is RS256 which
 * uses PKI between the token issuer and consumer. The flow requires a redirect
 * to a configured authentication server URL and a subsequent request with the
 * expected JWT token. This token is cryptographically verified and validated.
 * The user identity is then extracted from the token and used to create an
 * AuthenticationToken - as expected by the AuthenticationFilter.
