Calculates the amount of resources that need to be freed up (by killing
   * opportunistic containers) in order for the given guaranteed container to
   * start its execution. Resource allocation to be freed up =
   * <code>containersAllocation</code> -
   *   allocation of <code>opportunisticContainersToKill</code> +
   *   allocation of <code>queuedGuaranteedContainers</code> that will start
   *     before the given container +
   *   allocation of given container -
   *   total resources of node.
