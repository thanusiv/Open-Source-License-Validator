/**
   * Regression test for HDFS-2795:
   *  - Start an HA cluster with a DN.
   *  - Write several blocks to the FS with replication 1.
   *  - Shutdown the DN
   *  - Wait for the NNs to declare the DN dead. All blocks will be under-replicated.
   *  - Restart the DN.
   * In the bug, the standby node would only very slowly notice the blocks returning
   * to the cluster.
