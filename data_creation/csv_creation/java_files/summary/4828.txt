Partitions the key space.
 * 
 * <p><code>Partitioner</code> controls the partitioning of the keys of the 
 * intermediate map-outputs. The key (or a subset of the key) is used to derive
 * the partition, typically by a hash function. The total number of partitions
 * is the same as the number of reduce tasks for the job. Hence this controls
 * which of the <code>m</code> reduce tasks the intermediate key (and hence the 
 * record) is sent for reduction.</p>
