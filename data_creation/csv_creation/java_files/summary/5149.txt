/**
 * Used to describe the priority of the running job. 
 * DEFAULT : While submitting a job, if the user is not specifying priority,
 * YARN has the capability to pick the default priority as per its config.
 * Hence MapReduce can indicate such cases with this new enum.
 * UNDEFINED_PRIORITY : YARN supports priority as an integer. Hence other than
 * the five defined enums, YARN can consider other integers also. To generalize
 * such cases, this specific enum is used.
