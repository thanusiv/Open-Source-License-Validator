Defines the core heap usage emulation algorithm. This engine is expected
   * to perform certain memory intensive operations to consume some
   * amount of heap. {@link #load(long)} should load the current heap and 
   * increase the heap usage by the specified value. This core engine can be 
   * initialized using the {@link #initialize(ResourceCalculatorPlugin, long)} 
   * API to suit the underlying hardware better.
