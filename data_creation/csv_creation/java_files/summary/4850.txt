<p>The OpportunisticContainerAllocator allocates containers on a given list
 * of Nodes after it modifies the container sizes to within allowable limits
 * specified by the <code>ClusterManager</code> running on the RM. It tries to
 * distribute the containers as evenly as possible. It also uses the
 * <code>NMTokenSecretManagerInNM</code> to generate the required NM tokens for
 * the allocated containers</p>
