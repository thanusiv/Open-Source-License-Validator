/**
	 * Creates a new project resource with the selected name.
	 * <p>
	 * In normal usage, this method is invoked after the user has pressed Finish on
	 * the wizard; the enablement of the Finish button implies that all controls
	 * on the pages currently contain valid values.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that this wizard caches the new project once it has been successfully
	 * created; subsequent invocations of this method will answer the same
	 * project resource without attempting to create it again.
	 * </p>
