/*
 * This is the Memory Service test suite.
 * 
 * It is meant to be a regression suite to be executed automatically against
 * the DSF nightly builds.
 * 
 * It is also meant to be augmented with a proper test case(s) every time a
 * feature is added or in the event (unlikely :-) that a bug is found in the
 * Memory Service.
 * 
 * Refer to the JUnit4 documentation for an explanation of the annotations.
