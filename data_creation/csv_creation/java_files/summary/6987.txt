/**
 * Ticket #14080
 *
 * - The bug happen on push event.<br/>
 * - The changes in the DOM are css related.<br/>
 * - It seems like when the class attribute is set on push, the textarea revert
 * to the height defined by the rows attribute.<br/>
 * - The size is reseted on onStateChange where the size is set to the one from
 * the state. And it's because, when the user changes the text, at the next poll
 * the state will confirm the change of the text, but the width and height
 * didn't change in the state either client or server before the fix.
