 Extracts required information from FunctionCallExpressions that call
 * QObject::connect.  This implementation handles all overloads of QObject::connect
 * except the QMetaMethod related ones.  QMetaMethods cannot be statically analyzed
 * so they are ignored.

 * The binding is found by identifying the overload and then looking at the appropriate
 * parameters.
