//  TODO:  Should we do extra checks here to determine if a build is really needed,
						//         or do you just do exclusion checks like above?
						//         We could check for:
						//         o  The build goal name
						//         o  A secondary output
						//         o  An input file to a tool:
						//            o  Has an extension of a source file used by a tool
						//            o  Has an extension of a header file used by a tool
						//            o  Has the name of an input file specified in an InputType via:
						//               o  An Option
						//               o  An AdditionalInput
